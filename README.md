# MoffetFieldMuseumApplication
I am currently producing this application to assist the Moffet Field Museum. I am leading in app development and software, and Ankita Kundu created this project and is working with the museum. This application uses https://gitmoji.carloscuesta.me/ to manage the github commits.
